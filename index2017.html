<p>In 1994, <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/jeps/friends/" class="normalLink"><em>the Friends of the Jepson Herbarium</em></a> began a program to provide educational opportunities for a broad audience of professional and amateur botanists. Today, the program continues to serve as a liaison between the scientific community and the public, a role we are dedicated to as we enter our 23rd year of public programs. For 2017, the Jepson Workshop Series is proud to offer course offerings in botany, plant taxonomy, regional floras, ecology and more. Join us for another great year of learning about the flora of California!

	  <!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="feedbackLink">Workshop is full! Wait list only.</span> --></p>

	<p><span class="workshopDate">March 4&ndash;5, 2017</span><br />
		  <span class="workshopInstructors"><a href="#BM">Brent Mishler</a>, <a href="#KK">Ken Kellman</a></span><br /> 
		  <span class="workshopLocation">UC Berkeley and Bay Area field sites</span><br />
	</p>

<p class="workshopBody">The bryophytes are a diverse group of small stature but large ecological impact. There are some 23,000 described species worldwide, making it the largest group of land plants except for the flowering plants. The group includes three phylogenetically distinct lineages: mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The bryophytes are a &ldquo;key&rdquo; group in our understanding of how the modern land plants (comprising the three bryophyte lineages plus the vascular plants) are related to each other phylogenetically and how they came to conquer the land environment. Although the bryophytes display much diversity, a major limitation in the use of bryophytes as study organisms has been the lack of basic floristic, ecological, and alpha-taxonomic knowledge of the plants in many regions, of which California and the southwestern United States are the most poorly known in North America.</p>

<p class="workshopBody">The first day, participants will learn about basic bryophyte biology, some simple but necessary microtechniques in the lab, and the basic structure of bryophytes along with taxonomically useful characteristics. The second day, after a morning lab session, the class will caravan to a field site and learn to identify major bryophyte groups and discuss and observe their general ecology and evolutionary features. Participants should be prepared to hike up to four miles on Sunday, in possibly wet weather conditions.</p>

<p class="workshopBody">Prepare to put on your &ldquo;plant goggles&rdquo; for this beginner's guide to understanding what to look for in order to name your favorite plants. Learn about the diverse ways that plants adapt and present themselves to the world and how we can use this knowledge to inform plant identification. Discover endless possibilities for leaf shape and just exactly how many ways there are to describe plant hairs (yes, hairs)&mdash; many more than there are for humans! This course welcomes all novices who are ready and willing to expand their botanical knowledge, as well as enthusiasts that need a refresher. Students will learn basic botanical vocabulary and observation skills needed to identify plants by sight and under the microscope, providing the background necessary to use botanical keys like the second edition of <em>The Jepson Manual</em>. This course will reveal the truth behind why oranges are in fact a berry but why a strawberry is actually not one, and explain what exactly <em>is</em> an artichoke!</p>

<p class="workshopBody">Are you ready to jump into botanical detective work? With a working knowledge of common plant families, and comfort in using taxonomic keys, identification can be an enjoyable challenge. This workshop introduces students to the flora of the San Francisco Bay area and the techniques used to identify plants of California. Emphasis will be on learning to recognize characteristics of the Bay Area’s plant families. We will practice keying plants in the field using the third edition of the book <em>Plants of the San Francisco Bay Region: Mendocino to Monterey</em> (Linda H. Beidleman and Eugene N. Kozloff, 2014). A general familiarity with morphological terms is helpful but not necessary; these will be reviewed during the introductory session. The workshop will be held outdoors (rain or shine). We will have one van available for transportation to field sites. Participants may drive up to 75 miles per day to the field sites and walk up to three miles each day (easy hiking). This workshop will not involve collection of plants. Students must attend all four days of the workshop, because the introductory information will lay the foundation for the rest of the workshop. Please note that this is an introductory workshop, geared towards beginning botanists. Participants must purchase their own copy of the book. (Registration preference will be given to individuals who have not previously attended 50 Families in the Field.)</p>

<p class="workshopBody">This workshop will focus on the common intertidal seaweeds of Bodega Head, a wild and diverse area and good representative of the northern California coast. Our home base at the Bodega Marine Laboratory provides easy access to the field. The low tides on Saturday and Sunday are in the morning (8:00 am and 9:00 am, respectively); we will try to get out to each site at least a half hour before the low. Our overview in the field will include the basics of seaweed ecology. For detailed studies of seaweed identity and form, we will take a closer look at our "catch" in the lab during the afternoons.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">Beginners and experienced seaweed enthusiasts are welcome. We especially invite people interested in photography who are keen to contribute photos to <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/seaweedflora.html">California Seaweeds</a> an online seaweed flora that we will introduce during the workshop.

<p class="workshopBody">&ldquo;I am the grass; I cover all.&rdquo; &mdash;Carl Sandburg, &ldquo;Grass&rdquo;</p>
<p class="workshopBody">Prominent in plant communities throughout California, the grass family, Poaceae, is the state’s second most diverse plant family (after Asteraceae). Its members include cool-season and warm-season species, annuals and perennials, natives and exotics, and widespread dominants and rare endemics. This workshop will provide a better understanding of this ubiquitous, species-rich family. Participants will be instructed in detail on the vegetative and reproductive features of grasses. Aspects of anatomy, physiology, and ecology will also be addressed. Most time will be spent learning to use the identification keys in the second edition of The Jepson Manual. Special attention will be given to difficult couplets and taxa. In addition, participants will learn how to identify common genera by using diagnostic characteristics. If conditions are favorable, we will go to the field on Sunday afternoon; most of this class will take place in a lab classroom.</p>

<p class="workshopBody">Wetlands are typically recognized as soggy portions of the landscape that are covered—often intermittently—with shallow water, have soils saturated with water, or have plants that look different from those in the surrounding areas. Scientific studies have shown that wetlands are essential to maintaining the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the aquatic ecosystem. State and federal programs have been established that regulate impacts to wetlands as part of their overall water quality protection strategy. These agencies differ in how wetlands are defined and how they are geographically delineated.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">This workshop will emphasize the definition and delineation method for wetlands used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to define their jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Wetland definitions and delineation methods used by state and other agencies in California, including the California Coastal Commission (CCC), State Water Quality Control Board and its Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will also be discussed in comparison to wetland definitions and delineation methods used by the Corps and USEPA. Other types of aquatic habitats in addition to wetlands and how they are identified and delineated by the Corps, USEPA, and other state and federal agencies will also be discussed. The course offers a clear and concise explanation and comparison of wetland definitions and methods used by these agencies including the latest changes in methodology and approaches for determining jurisdictional boundaries; explanation of key terminology, and practical hands-on field experience for private consultants, agency personnel, attorneys, academics, and the general public who are involved with resource protection, impact assessment, environmental restoration, and/or seeking project authorization from the CCC, RWQCB, CDFW, or Corps. The course instructor’s primary method of instruction is &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; so prepare yourself to get dirty!</p>
<p class="workshopBody">We will meet at Rush Ranch Thursday morning and afternoon for classroom lectures and training exercises that will acquaint participants with the various definitions, terminology, and delineation approach methodologies. We will spend Friday and Saturday in the field gaining real-world experience with the meanings of definitions and associated terminology through hands-on experience using the various wetland delineation methodologies, with analysis of results and field delineation of wetland-upland boundaries. This will include exploring how and why the various definitions and associated methodologies produce different results in terms of wetland area delineated. Class will be held rain or shine!	</p>

<p class="workshopBody">Butterflies are conspicuous insects familiar to anyone who has walked outdoors on a sunny day. While some species have become rare or threatened due to habitat loss, many are ubiquitous in both urban and rural landscapes. Their caterpillars feed externally on plants, often sequestering toxins from their host plants to aid in their own defense. In this workshop, through classroom presentations, discussion, and hands-on activities we will explore the diversity of butterflies, their life cycles and host plants, behaviors, and identification, with a special focus on California and the Bay Area. We will then tour the Essig Museum of Entomlogy, including the now extinct Xerces blue butterfly, then head to the field to spot caterpillars and butterflies. We will also discuss how to promote butterflies in your own neighborhood by providing resources for both larvae and adults.</p>

<p class="workshopBody">This four-day workshop is designed for beginning to amateur botanists to learn how to identify California plants by family and acquire the tools needed for continuing the self-education process of plant identification. Lectures and lab activities will emphasize the characteristics that are most useful for family-level plant identification. We will learn how to use the family key in the second edition of <em>The Jepson Manual</em>, which contains 185 native or naturalized vascular plant families, with a combination of field collections in the Bay Area and lab work using both fresh material and herbarium specimens.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">A familiarity with botanical terms is helpful but not required. There will be a pre-workshop reading list, which will assist in providing familiarity with (or review of) technical terms so as to make getting through the workshop significantly easier. Participants will receive a 9” x 12” field press with a binder for their plant collections. The use of a dissecting kit and a dissecting microscope during lab sessions will be available for each student. Previous dissecting and/or microscope experience is helpful but not necessary. Students must attend all four days of the workshop; each part of the workshop will establish the foundation for the following sessions.</p>

	  <span class="workshopLocation">Yolla Bolly Wilderness&ndash;Middle Eel Wilderness</span>
	</p>

<p class="workshopBody">The coast ranges of California are a patchwork of difficult to access, public and private lands that include: high and low elevation ecosystems; a variety of longitudinal and latitudinal gradients; a complex assemblage of bedrock and soil types; a myriad of climate regimes; and many areas where different floristic regions (and subregions) converge. All of these factors drive a high level of diversity. Due to the inaccessibility of the coast ranges they harbor many under-collected localities.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">The Yolla Bolly&ndash;Middle Eel Wilderness is an area of the high North Coast Range of California that is lightly visited and poorly known botanically.  We will be venturing into the northern end of the wilderness, in Tehama County on the Shasta&ndash;Trinity National Forest, to explore and document the flora.  We will hike into a group camp site on the first day while our gear is packed in by mule!  The first evening we will explore the area around our camp and begin compiling a plant list.  The next two days will be spent on day hikes to nearby areas, potentially including Black Rock, North Yolla Bolly (disjunct location of foxtail pine, <em>Pinus balfouriana</em>), Cedar Basin (southernmost location of aspen in the Klamath/Coast Ranges), and Pettijohn Basin.  Plant ID, assisted by the instructors, will be done throughout the day and back at camp in the evenings.  Participants will have the opportunity to collect and press specimens for donation to California herbaria.</p>
<p class="workshopBody"><em>Note: this workshop is a four day/three night back-country camping trip. Participants are expected to bring the required gear listed below (and sent out on the packing list) and should be comfortable spending the full duration of the workshop in a remote campsite with no access to cell phone reception or amenities.</em></p>

	  <span class="workshopLocation">Tejon Conservancy and Tejon Ranch</span>
	</p>

<p class="workshopBody">The 270,000 acre Tejon Ranch, located in Kern and Los Angeles counties, is the largest contiguous private property in California and, until recently, was largely inaccessible to the public. It is a region of great biological diversity that lies at the confluence of five biogeographic provinces (Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley, Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, and Mojave Desert) and four floristic regions. As such, this area is a haven for pristine vegetation, rare and endemic species, ancient oak trees, and intact watersheds.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">In 2008, an agreement was made between the Tejon Ranch Company, the owner of the property, and five major environmental groups that up to 90% of the property (~240,000 acres) will be protected through conservation easements managed by the Tejon Ranch Conservancy.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">This workshop will introduce participants to the biogeography and summer flora of the Tejon Ranch. Depending on road conditions, we will explore a variety of grassland, scrubland, woodland, forest, and desert communities. Tejon Ranch is home to many special-status plant species and we expect to see some of these, including the Tehachapi buckwheat (<em>Eriogonum callistum</em>), which is endemic to the ranch.  If we are lucky, we may even see California condors flying overhead.).</p>	
<p>
	<span class="workshopLocation">Lodging: Participants have the option to stay in dorm-style rooms (limit 11) at the Bloom House on Tejon Ranch property for an <b>additional</b> $30/night or camp on the adjacent Bloom House property (with access to house kitchen and bathrooms) for no additional cost.</span><br />

<p class="workshopBody">Beginning with an overview of morphological characteristics of composites (family-wide), including a review of terms used in descriptions and keys, we will provide a synopsis of diversity within Compositae and a brief introduction to recognition of tribes. Then, we will concentrate on identifying the diversity of summer/fall&mdash;flowering composites that go unnoticed by spring-oriented botanists and will consider their evolutionary relationships and natural history. We hope this workshop will provide participants with botanical enthusiasm for California’s second spring, well after the last of the early-season bloom fades. This workshop does not include a field trip. Familiarity with a dissecting microscope and experience using dichotomous keys is useful but not essential.</p>

<p class="workshopBody">This course will begin with an overview of what drives climate change now and what has driven it in the recent past. We will then discuss the physics of the greenhouse effect and our planet’s energy budget. Moving on, we will leave the present for a Deep Time perspective on climate, ranging from the extreme cold 650 million years ago to the end-Permian hot house. Before lunch, we end closer to home with the climate oscillation of the recent ice ages (last few millions of years) and its effect on North American floras.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">In the afternoon, we will examine the impacts of climate change on society and environment focusing on California, and consider actions at the local, regional and state level to address these challenges. Participants will be asked to consider likely impacts in their own communities and how to balance competing demands, for example increasing protection from sea level rise vs. heat waves, or how to manage parks to achieve biodiversity conservation in a changing environment. Come prepared with your own questions about climate change for fruitful group discussion on the topic.</p>

	</p>
<p class="workshopBody">Plant galls provide a fascinating array of color and texture on many of the plants in our California landscape. Galls, growths of plant cells that are not normal plant organs, can be induced by a number of organisms. The most numerous as well as most beautiful and intriguing are those induced by insects. Two insect families are found only in plant galls: Cynipidae (gall wasps) and Cecidomyiidae (gall midges or gnats). Plant galls also host a whole ecology of other insects, including herbivorous inquilines and carnivorous parasitoids like the wasp family Ormyridae, which is found only in plant galls. Most of these organisms are too small for us to see, so that the only thing we notice is the colorful gall growth itself.</p>
<p class="workshopBody">In this workshop, we will start by exploring the diversity of extant insect-induced plant galls and the community of species found within them. Our study will begin with a series of lectures covering gall induction, development, plant host specificity, and inducer life histories using Joyce Gross' excellent photographic images of galls and gall insects. We will then take a short campus field trip to learn how to find galls. Back in the classroom, we will dissect galls under microscopes to examine their intricate structures and view the occupiers. We will wrap up with discussion about the evolution of the plant host-plant gall interrelationships with examples from fossil galls.</p>
