-->
 
	<p class="normal">1. Read <a href="../workshopFAQ.html">Code of Conduct &amp; FAQ</a> before proceeding.	</p>		
	<p class="normal">2. Registration can be completed only by mail, or <em>by phone after January 16</em>.</p>
	
	<p class="normal">3. Workshop course fees above $150 require a $75 non-refundable deposit and must be paid in full no later than 30 days before the workshop (full payment at registration is okay). Workshop course fees $150 or below require payment in full at the time of registration.</p>
			
	<p class="normal">4. We accept payment by check (<strong><u>preferred</u></strong>) made out to UC Regents, or Visa and Mastercard (<em>via phone registration</em>). Do not enclose your credit card
		information with your mail-in registration.</p>
	<p class="normal">5. Workshops are limited to 20 participants (occasionally less). If your desired workshop is full, you can opt to go on the waitlist.  To do so, please still send in a registration form,
		but do not include any payment in this case.	</p>	
	<p class="normal">6. Workshop reservations may be cancelled up to 30 days prior to the start date and you will be refunded the workshop fee, less the $75 non-refundable deposit.</p>	
	<p class="normal">7. All participants must pre-register by filling out our registration form. 
						Use one form <em>per participant</em> only.</p>
						
	<p class="normal"><strong>Please note that by registering for our workshops, you agree to the above Registration and Cancellation policies</strong>.
		
		
<!--				<p class="normal">We recommend you read our <a href="../workshopFAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> before registering for a workshop. </p>
                Course fees are listed as <em>Jepson Friend</em> Member/General Public.</p>
				<p class="normal">Workshops with registration fees of $150 or less require full payment for enrollment.</p>
				<p class="normal">We require a <strong>non-refundable</strong> $75 deposit for each workshop that has a registration fee of more than $150. Full payment for these workshops can be made at the time of registration but is not required. If full payment is not received at the time of registration, you will receive an invoice for the balance due 60 days prior to the workshop date. If full payment is not received 30 days before the start of the workshop, your space will be forfeited.<br /><br />
              
			    Our workshops tend to fill quickly, so please register as soon as practicable. It can be difficult to accommodate last-minute registration requests (for example, we often need to order supplies, including food for meals), so we encourage you to register at least two weeks in advance, if not sooner. We appreciate full payment at the time of registration for workshops that are within 60 days: this way, we don't have to immediately send you an invoice for the balance due. <br /><br />
       
       If a workshop is full and you would like to be added to the wait list, complete a registration form and submit it to the Herbarium. We will contact you by email or phone to let you know that we have received your wait list request. <strong>You do not need to include payment</strong>: we will collect your deposit (or full workshop fee, as applicable) if a space becomes available for you.
</p>
<p class="normal">We accept checks made payable to <em>UC Regents</em>, Visa, and Mastercard. <strong>Checks are our preferred method of payment</strong>. If you must pay with a credit card, we will call you to get your card information over the phone. Please do not write any credit card details on your registration form!</p> 
			  <p><span class="workshopTitle">Cancellation Policy</span></p> 
			  <p class="normal"> The <em>Friends</em> staff will only cancel a workshop at the request of the instructor or because of insufficient enrollment. If <strong>we</strong> cancel a workshop, each enrolled participant will receive either a full refund or a credit voucher, which can be used for a future workshop.
			  <p>If you have to cancel, please notify the Jepson Herbarium as soon as practicable. The date of cancellation is the date that written notice (email or mail) is received by the <em>Friends</em> staff.</p>
<p>If your cancellation is received more than 30 days before the start of the course, you will receive a refund or credit voucher, less the $75 deposit.
Within 30 days of the start of the course, no refunds will be issued.</p> 
<p><span class="workshopTitle">Registration Procedure and Registration Form</span></p>
				
				<p class="normal">1. Read our registration and cancellation policies (above). By registering for a workshop, you agree to the terms of these policies. No exceptions to the cancellation policy will be made, even in the case of a personal or professional emergency.</p>
				<p class="normal">2. Pre-registration is required for all workshops.</p> 
				<p class="normal">3. Complete the registration form with your workshop selection(s), contact information, and payment information.  <a href="2016RegForm.pdf">Click here</a> for a printable registration form. <strong>Use a separate form for each person</strong>.</p> 
				<p class="normal">4. Mail your registration form and payment to the Jepson Herbarium. Please note that for security reasons, <strong><font color="red">we do not accept payment information via fax or email</font></strong>. Online registration is not available. After January 15, 2016, you may register by phone for workshops if you are paying with a credit card. Please call (510) 643-7008 between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM and speak to a member of the workshop staff. Do not leave credit card information on the message machine: it is not secure.</p> 
                <p class="normal">5. We will send you a confirmation email (or letter, if you do not have email) within 10 business days of receiving your registration request. If a workshop is full we will contact you by email or phone to let you know. Detailed workshop information and an invoice for balance due (if applicable) will be emailed to registered participants approximately 28 days before the workshop date.	</p>
