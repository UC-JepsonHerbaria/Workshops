Friends of the Jepson Herbarium Workshop Series


In 1994, the Friends of the Jepson Herbarium began a program to provide educational opportunities for a broad audience of professional and amateur botanists. Today, the program continues to serve as a liaison between the scientific community and the public, a role we are dedicated to as we enter our 23rd year of public programs. For 2017, the Jepson Workshop Series is proud to offer course offerings in botany, plant taxonomy, regional floras, ecology and more.
